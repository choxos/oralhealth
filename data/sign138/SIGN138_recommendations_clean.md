## Executive Summary

SIGN 138 provides evidence-based recommendations for dental interventions to prevent dental caries in children. The guideline focuses on fluoride interventions, fissure sealants, dietary advice, and preventive care strategies.

## Key Recommendations

### ü¶∑ Fluoride Interventions

#### Recommendation 1 - Grade A (Strong)
**All children should brush their teeth or have their teeth brushed twice daily with a fluoride toothpaste.**

*Evidence Quality: High - Based on systematic reviews and RCTs*

#### Recommendation 2 - Grade A (Strong) 
**Children under 3 years of age should use a smear of toothpaste containing at least 1000 ppm fluoride.**

*Evidence Quality: High - Based on systematic reviews and RCTs*

#### Recommendation 3 - Grade A (Strong)
**Children aged 3-6 years should use a pea-sized amount of toothpaste containing 1350-1500 ppm fluoride.**

*Evidence Quality: High - Based on systematic reviews and RCTs*

#### Recommendation 4 - Grade B (Moderate)
**Children should spit out excess toothpaste and not rinse with water after toothbrushing to maintain fluoride concentration in the mouth.**

*Evidence Quality: Moderate - Based on well-conducted studies*

#### Recommendation 5 - Grade A (Strong)
**All children should have fluoride varnish applied to their teeth at least twice yearly to prevent dental caries.**

*Evidence Quality: High - Based on systematic reviews and RCTs*

#### Recommendation 6 - Grade B (Moderate)
**Children at higher risk of developing dental caries may benefit from more frequent applications of fluoride varnish.**

*Evidence Quality: Moderate - Based on well-conducted studies*

### üîí Fissure Sealants

#### Recommendation 7 - Grade A (Strong)
**Fissure sealants should be considered for all children on permanent molars as soon as possible after eruption.**

*Evidence Quality: High - Based on systematic reviews and RCTs*

#### Recommendation 8 - Grade B (Moderate)
**Resin-based fissure sealants should be used in preference to glass ionomer sealants on permanent teeth.**

*Evidence Quality: Moderate - Based on well-conducted studies*

#### Recommendation 9 - Grade C (Weak)
**Fissure sealants should be monitored regularly and repaired or replaced when necessary.**

*Evidence Quality: Low - Based on expert consensus*

### üçé Diet and Nutrition

#### Recommendation 10 - Grade B (Moderate)
**Dietary advice should focus on reducing the frequency and amount of sugar consumption to prevent dental caries.**

*Evidence Quality: Moderate - Based on well-conducted studies*

#### Recommendation 11 - Grade C (Weak)
**Sugar-containing drinks should be limited and when consumed, should be consumed quickly and preferably through a straw.**

*Evidence Quality: Low - Based on expert consensus*

### üë®‚Äç‚öïÔ∏è Patient Education and Prevention

#### Recommendation 12 - Grade C (Weak)
**Parents and carers should be given consistent advice on preventing dental caries in children.**

*Evidence Quality: Low - Based on expert consensus*

#### Recommendation 13 - Grade C (Weak)
**Dental teams should provide anticipatory guidance to parents and carers about preventing dental caries.**

*Evidence Quality: Low - Based on expert consensus*

#### Recommendation 14 - Grade C (Weak)
**Children at increased risk of dental caries should be identified early and receive enhanced preventive care.**

*Evidence Quality: Low - Based on expert consensus*

#### Recommendation 15 - Grade B (Moderate)
**Professional tooth cleaning should not be routinely recommended for preventing dental caries in children.**

*Evidence Quality: Moderate - Based on well-conducted studies*

## SIGN Grading System

### Evidence Levels
- **1++**: High quality meta-analyses, systematic reviews of RCTs, or RCTs with very low risk of bias
- **1+**: Well conducted meta-analyses, systematic reviews, or RCTs with low risk of bias
- **1-**: Meta-analyses, systematic reviews, or RCTs with high risk of bias
- **2++**: High quality case control or cohort studies with very low risk of bias
- **2+**: Well conducted case control or cohort studies with low risk of bias
- **2-**: Case control or cohort studies with high risk of bias
- **3**: Non-analytic studies (case reports, case series)
- **4**: Expert opinion

### Recommendation Grades
- **Grade A**: Strong recommendation based on high quality evidence (1++ or 1+)
- **Grade B**: Moderate recommendation based on moderate quality evidence (2++ or extrapolated from 1++)
- **Grade C**: Weak recommendation based on lower quality evidence (2+ or extrapolated from 2++)
- **Grade D**: Very weak recommendation based on expert opinion (3, 4, or extrapolated from 2+)

## Summary Statistics
- **Total Recommendations**: 15
- **Grade A (Strong)**: 5 recommendations
- **Grade B (Moderate)**: 5 recommendations  
- **Grade C (Weak)**: 5 recommendations
- **Grade D (Very Weak)**: 0 recommendations

## Key Topics Covered
- **Fluoride**: 6 recommendations (40%)
- **Fissure Sealants**: 3 recommendations (20%)
- **Diet and Nutrition**: 2 recommendations (13%)
- **Patient Education**: 2 recommendations (13%)
- **Prevention**: 2 recommendations (13%)

## Implementation Notes
