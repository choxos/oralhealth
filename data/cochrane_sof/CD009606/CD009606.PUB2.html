<td align="" valign="" colspan="1" rowspan="1" bgcolor="#ffffff"> <p>This review is made up almost entirely of singleâstudy comparisons of very small studies. For each comparison, the evidence for the primary outcomes 'failure of the prosthesis', 'complications' and 'aesthetic evaluation' at all times of assessment was rated as being very low quality. All bodies of evidence were downgraded by 1 level for risk of bias and by 2 levels for imprecision (due to singleâstudy comparisons with either very small sample sizes, low event rates, 95% CIs including the possibility of benefit for both the test and control groups, or combinations of these problems) </p> <p>This review has included studies assessing the following comparisons</p> <p>1) Metalâfree single crowns compared to conventional crowns</p> <p>2) Metalâfree FDPs compared to metalâceramic FDPs</p> <p>3) Metalâfree cantilevered FDPs compared to metalâceramic cantilevered FDPs</p> <p>4) Metalâfree implantâsupported single crowns compared to metalâceramic implantâsupported single crowns </p> <p>5) Metalâfree abutments compared to metal abutments supporting single crowns</p> <p>6) Metalâfree implantâsupported FDPs made of different materials</p> <p>7) Metalâfree toothâsupported FDPs made of different materials</p> </td> </tr>
