We did not downgrade evidence on the basis of overall risk of bias classifications of the two studies because these studies were otherwise well conducted even though they were not graded as having overall low risk of bias because the blinding of outcome measurement was incomplete. The incomplete blinding of outcome measurement was judged not to be a fundamental issue in assessing the quality of evidence in preventive sealant studies.",FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE
