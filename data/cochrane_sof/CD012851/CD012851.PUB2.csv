Downgraded two levels for indirectness. Two studies were at high risk of bias due to concerns with how representative the samples were of people with PDC and in particular the very high prevalence of participants judged to have bilateral PDCs (unilateral:bilateral PDC ratio 1:3.8) (Bonetti 2010; Bonetti 2011).",FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE

Downgraded one level for indirectness. Some clinicians would consider 48 months too long to observe a patient before intervening.
Downgraded one level for indirectness. Two studies had a high proportion of the canines (85%) judged to be either in sector 1 (37 participants) or sector 2 (110 participants) (Bonetti 2010; Bonetti 2011). Not all clinicians would consider these teeth to be palatally displaced, particularly considering how young some of the participants were at baseline.",FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE
