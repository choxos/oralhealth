OSCC or OPMD symptom‐free individuals screened opportunistically or through an organised screening programme,Conventional oral examination/visual inspection,NA,OSCC or OPMD,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,25568,10,Low,"3 studies were judged to be at low risk of bias overall. 5 studies were judged to be at unclear risk of bias primarily due to insufficient information regarding blinding of the results of the index test. 2 studies were judged to be at high risk of bias arising from the flow and timing domain (high levels of attrition following a positive screen and time from positive screen to receipt of the reference standard). We judged concern regarding the applicability of the studies to the review question to be high for the patient selection domain for 1 study that recruited males only in a hospital setting, 1 study that recruited male smokers, and 1 study that recruited participants that had previously received treatment for head and neck cancer",FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE
OSCC or OPMD symptom‐free individuals screened through an organised screening programme,Mouth self‐examination,NA,OSCC or OPMD,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,35059,4,Very low,"The overall risk of bias for the studies that evaluated mouth self?evaluation was judged to be unclear for 3 studies and high for 1 study.We judged concern regarding the applicability of the studies to the review question to be high for the patient selection domain for 1 study that recruited and evaluated participants with Fanconi anaemia in a hospital setting, and participants that were identified and invited to participate based on their physician assessed risk of oral cancer",FALSE,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE
OSCC or OPMD symptom‐free individuals with tobacco habits,Conventional oral examination plus vital rinsing (toluidine blue),Conventional oral examination alone,Oral cancer as indicated by the National Cancer Registry,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,7975,1,Moderate,"Low risk of bias for patient selection, index test, and flow and timing domains, unclear risk of bias for reference standard as whether this was interpreted without knowledge of the results of the index tests is unclear.We judged the trial to be of high concern regarding applicability for the patient selection domain as individuals who ""lacked oral habits"" such as smoking or betel quid chewing were ineligible for the trial",FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE
OSCC or OPMD symptom‐free individuals screened through an organised screening programme,Remote screening of the oral cavity,NA,OSCC or OPMD,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,3600,3,Very low,"The overall risk of bias was judged to be low in the organised screening programme and unclear in the pilot and feasibility studies due to a lack of information regarding the patient selection and index tests.Concern regarding the overall applicability of the studies to the review question was high for 2 studies arising from the patient selection domain where the samples were primarily composed of older, male smokers",FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE
