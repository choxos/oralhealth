Asymptomatic children or adults presenting for clinical examination (clinical studies); extracted teeth of children or adults (in vitro studies). Clinical or in vitro studies which intentionally included dentine and frank cavitations for assessment were excluded,Visual classification. Results of the index tests were usually recorded on an ordinal scale to indicate severity of disease. For the purposes of this review the positivity threshold was caries in enamel,"Estimates were compared across different classification systems.

Only 2 studies were considered to be at low risk of bias overall. Across the 4 domains, the patient selection domain had the highest number of studies judged at high risk of bias (49 studies); we judged the index test, reference standard, and flow and timing domains to have a low proportion of studies at high risk of bias (4, 9, and 7 studies respectively). All studies avoided a case‐control design, the majority avoiding inappropriate exclusions (96%), but consecutive or random sampling was used in only 10% of studies. Most included studies were in vitro studies using histology as the reference standard, and likely to correctly classify the target condition, however some studies used an imperfect reference standard such as excavation, radiographs, or a visual examination after separation of the approximal surfaces

Applicability of evidence to question

15 studies were considered to have low concern for applicability across all domains. We judged 49 studies of extracted teeth to be of high concern for applicability of the sample population, with the remaining clinical studies directly applicable to our review question. Concern regarding applicability for the index test domain was also high (46 studies). Most studies were in vitro studies (48 studies), 18 studies carried out the index test evaluations in a clinical setting, 1 study carried out the clinical assessment in a school setting. The dominance of in vitro studies also means that information on how the results of these devices are used to support diagnosis, as opposed to pure detection, is limited
